          <h5>Professor of Radiology, Full member of Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania</h5>
          <p>Dr. Zhou was trained as a biophysicist and has a strong track record in developing in vivo quantitative imaging tools that can be translated to the clinic. She has integrated these imaging tools in the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting cancer microenvironment, bioenergetics and glutamine metabolism in mouse models. She will co-lead the development of this imaging resource that includes (1) optimization of the preclinical quantitative MRI methods for probing tumor microenvironment, (2) conducting the co-clinical trial (in mice and in human) in which the utilities of imaging tools will be examined, and finally (3) outreaching to research community via sharing of data and resources developed in this project.</p>

          <p>Dr. Song is a biomedical engineer with a strong background in MRI physics and expertise in various areas of MRI engineering. Dr. Song has extensive experience in developing novel dynamic imaging strategies in MRI. For over a decade, his research has focused on the development of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) MRI strategies based on novel radial data acquisition and reconstruction methods that allow ultra-rapid dynamic imaging at both high spatial and high temporal resolutions. Utilizing the golden angle radial acquisition strategy, Dr. Song also developed and implemented effective strategies to retrospectively compensate for respiratory motion in DCE-MRI. </p>
